abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are appealing models for subset selection prob-lems where diversity is desired. They offer surprisingly efficient inference, including sam-pling in O(N 3) time and O(N 2) space, where N is the number of base items. However, in some applications, N may grow so large that sampling from a DPP becomes compu-tationally infeasible. This is especially true in settings where the DPP kernel matrix can-not be represented by a linear decomposition of low-dimensional feature vectors. In these cases, we propose applying the Nystr{\"{o}}m ap-proximation to project the kernel matrix into a low-dimensional space. While theoretical guarantees for the Nystr{\"{o}}m approximation in terms of standard matrix norms have been previously established, we are concerned with probabilistic measures, like total variation dis-tance between the DPP and its Nystr{\"{o}}m ap-proximation, that behave quite differently. In this paper we derive new error bounds for the Nystr{\"{o}}m-approximated DPP and present em-pirical results to corroborate them. We then demonstrate the Nystr{\"{o}}m-approximated DPP by applying it to a motion capture summa-rization task.},

abstract = {Consider a finite weighted oriented graph. We study a probability measure on the set of spanning rooted oriented forests on the graph. We prove that the set of roots sampled from this measure is a determinantal process, characterized by a possibly non-symmetric kernel with complex eigenvalues. We then derive several results relating this measure to the Markov process associated with the starting graph, to the spectrum of its generator and to hitting times of subsets of the graph. In particular, the mean hitting time of the set of roots turns out to be independent of the starting point, conditioning or not to a given number of roots. Wilson's algorithm provides a way to sample this measure and, in absence of complex eigenvalues of the generator, we explain how to get samples with a number of roots approximating a prescribed integer. We also exploit the properties of this measure to give some probabilistic insight into the proof of an algebraic result due to Micchelli and Willoughby [13]. Further, we present two different related coalescence and fragmentation processes.},

abstract = {We show that repulsive random variables can yield Monte Carlo methods with faster convergence rates than the typical {\$}N{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of integrand evaluations. More precisely, we propose stochastic numerical quadratures involving determinantal point processes associated with multivariate orthogonal polynomials, and we obtain root mean square errors that decrease as {\$}N{\^{}}{\{}-(1+1/d)/2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}d{\$} is the dimension of the ambient space. First, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear statistics of a class of determinantal point processes, when the reference measure is a product measure supported on a hypercube, which satisfies the Nevai-class regularity condition, a result which may be of independent interest. Next, we introduce a Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the reference measure satisfies a stronger regularity condition. As a corollary, by taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to any measure with continuously derivable density. Loosely speaking, our method can be interpreted as a stochastic counterpart to Gaussian quadrature, which, at the price of some convergence rate, is easily generalizable to any dimension and has a more explicit error term.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are distributions over sets of items that model diversity using kernels. Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions, such as summary extraction in our experiments.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory. In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

This method was studied in [3], who motivated it as a promising method for column subset selection. However, the development of polynomial time sampling algorithms -- exact or approximate -- has been since open. We close this open problem by presenting (i) an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm; (ii) its derandomization that samples subsets satisfying the desired properties deterministically; and (iii) an efficient approximate sampling procedure using Markov chains that are provably fast mixing. Our algorithms can thus benefit downstream applications of dual volume sampling, such as column subset selection and experimental design.},

Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago.
